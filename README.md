This is a basic Android app built for the Walmart assessment. It pulls a list of countries from a JSON URL and shows them in a RecyclerView.

App shows name, region, code, and capital for each country.
Used Retrofit for network calls, ViewModel + LiveData to handle data + lifecycle stuff.

Also has basic error handling and works fine after screen rotation.
